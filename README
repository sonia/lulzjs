A simple javascript interpreter based on SpiderMonkey and Prototype.

You need the nspr library installed (libnspr4.so) [Probably if you have firefox you have that lib]
You also need the readline library (it's a GNU standard)

To compile the project do:

cd js
sudo ./compile.sh
cd ..
make
sudo make install
